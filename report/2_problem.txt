The problem we have chosen is to avoid randomly generated obstacles on a two dimensional plane. This means driving in one direction for as long as possible without crashing in to an obstacle, and the further the vehicle goes, the more obstacles spawn in, and thus, the harder it becomes to continue. This has applications in things such as self driving cars, as they have a similar working condition, having to navigate a two dimensional world without colliding with anything in the way such as other cars, street lamps, etc.
Originally, self driving cars used electric cables embedded into the road to follow, using a simple radio signal to know where to go [1]. This started with small scale tests, such as the 1939 Futurama exhibit, which featured scale models of a section of a city.
Some more experimentation was done with full sized cars and radio control, before eventually in 1986, a van named VaMoRswas completely self driving on roads with real time image processing [2].
This fundemental approach of real time image processing with traditional algorithms was more or less kept the same with incremental improvements up to the modern day, but the method we are utilising is a machine learning method. This was pioneered in 1989 with ALVINN, a basic neural network in charge of the steering of a car, with the power and braking being controlled by a human.
More contemporary self driving cars continue this neural network approach, with such examples as Waymo [3] continuing to use more and more advanced neural networks to control their vehicles, with faster computers enabling faster vehicles and more advanced detection and avoidance models.
This was taken to its extreme with RoboRace, running from 2015 to 2022, which utilised machine learning to drive multiple types of race car at high speed around a track.
Our aim is to create a simplified version of this problem, with a basic car and basic obstacles, but also to make it still applicable to a real world scenario.
